## **Urban Climate Patterns: Analysis of Urban Heat Islands**

![UHI Title](./images/UHI_Title.png)

The main goal of this project is to delve into climatological data for three cities---Dallas, Denton, and Arlington in and around the Dallas, TX region. The focus is on understanding and categorizing these cities based on the ***Urban Heat Island (UHI)*** scale.

In climatology, UHI denotes urban areas with higher temperatures compared to neighboring rural areas. This phenomenon arises due to the replacement of natural landscapes with structures that absorb and retain heat, forming what is commonly known as a "micro-climate." Essentially, a city's infrastructure creates its localized weather conditions.

By scrutinizing micro-climate data for Dallas, a major urban hub, along with Denton and Arlington as suburban counterparts, we aim to establish a classification system reflecting different UHI intensities and assign corresponding labels to these cities. Furthermore, a temporal analysis will be conducted to compare and contrast various weather patterns associated with different UHI intensities.

This project seeks to enhance understanding of how urbanization influences local climates, particularly in the context of the Dallas area, and contribute valuable insights into the classification and temporal patterns of Urban Heat Islands.

The dataset that I've gathered is from the National Center for Environmental Information [(NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/).
